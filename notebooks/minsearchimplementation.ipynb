      "Based on the provided text, it can be inferred that the impact of the foreign exchange directive for Ethiopian banks is significant. The directive aims to regulate and standardize the foreign exchange market in Ethiopia, ensuring transparency, stability, and efficiency in foreign exchange transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the impacts of the directive on Ethiopian banks include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Regulation of foreign exchange transactions: The directive establishes regulations for foreign exchange transactions, including reporting requirements, exchange rates, and usage of foreign currencies.\n",
      "2. Standardization of exchange rates: The directive introduces the concept of the indicative daily exchange rate, which serves as a reference price for foreign exchange transactions. This helps to standardize exchange rates and ensures that banks are using the same rates for their transactions.\n",
      "3. Increased transparency: The directive requires banks to report their exchange rates and foreign exchange transactions, providing more transparency and accountability in the foreign exchange market.\n",
      "4. Reduced liquidity risks: The directive's requirement for banks to report their exchange rates and foreign exchange transactions helps to reduce liquidity risks by providing a more accurate picture of market conditions and exchange rates.\n",
      "5. Enhanced risk management: The directive's regulations on foreign exchange transactions, including the use of hedges and the management of foreign exchange risk, help to enhance risk management practices in Ethiopian banks.\n",
      "6. Support for the development of the foreign exchange market: The directive's support for the development of the interbank foreign exchange market, including the requirement for banks to repatriate foreign exchange earnings, helps to promote the growth and stability of the foreign exchange market in Ethiopia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the foreign exchange directive has a significant impact on Ethiopian banks, promoting transparency, stability, and efficiency in foreign exchange transactions.\n"
