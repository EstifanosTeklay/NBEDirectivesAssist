NBE(National Bank of Ethiopia) releases new directives frequently and extracting valuable information from that document is very challangeing for banking workers.
inorder to find the necessary information they have to go through and read every document. and the project aims to develop a RAG system to solve this problem.

Steps.

The first step in Building this RAG system is the collection of National Bank of Ethiopia Directives and then converting them to suitable Json files.
